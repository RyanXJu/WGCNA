<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

In this project, I use WGCNA to mine the gene expression data extract from RNA-seq dataset of Leucegene corhort. Objectif is to discover new gene expression signature or biomarkers related to AML.

* [WGCNA](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-9-559)

Weighted correlation network analysis, also known as weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), is a widely used data mining method especially for studying biological networks based on pairwise correlations between variables. While it can be applied to most high-dimensional data sets, it has been most widely used in genomic applications. It allows one to define modules (clusters), intramodular hubs, and network nodes with regard to module membership, to study the relationships between co-expression modules, and to compare the network topology of different networks (differential network analysis). WGCNA can be used as a data reduction technique (related to oblique factor analysis), as a clustering method (fuzzy clustering), as a feature selection method (e.g. as gene screening method), as a framework for integrating complementary (genomic) data (based on weighted correlations between quantitative variables), and as a data exploratory technique
